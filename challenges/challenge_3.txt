ExPecto could predict which allele was harmful or protective, without any prior information about the association of disease variants. Taken together, our results suggest that this approach is a promising direction for large-scale disease risk prediction, which will be especially useful for interpreting the huge number of potential mutations associated with the disease, about which there is practically no prior knowledge.
While the ExPecto models are accurate, scalable, and reliable, there is still potential to further improve both the accuracy and coverage of the predicted options.
Such analyses could be used in the future to group patients in drug and other treatment studies, to identify subtypes of diseases and, ultimately, for personalized treatment. At the same time, we expect that using information about the evolution of the human genome, as allowed by sequence-based expression modeling, will provide valuable information necessary for a comprehensive understanding of healthy and painful modes of human gene expression.
